speaker_bio: I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Airy, with experience in end to end data projects: data collection, data warehousing, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning. My interests are causal inference and natural language processing.
speaker_abstract: The goal of this session is to share how to identify **when** any change occurs in your data. 
    It will start with an explanation of change point analysis and some of the available techniques. 
    To make it more practical, there will be a demonstration of how to implement **single change point analysis** using the cumulative sum approach, mean squared error, and Bayesian approach (if the time is still available).
