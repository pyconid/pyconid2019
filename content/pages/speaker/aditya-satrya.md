speaker_bio: I am an engineer interested in building technology for great good impact. Work relatively close with the areas of devops, cloud-native, software engineering, and data engineering.
speaker_abstract: It's maybe too late if we realized performance issues in our app if it's already in production. Run performance tests in production-scale before it hits production server. Even better, run it automatically and integrated in CI/CD. I'll describe how Locust, a python library, can do that for you!
    My talk will be broken down into these points:
    1) Load testing: what, why, and how?
    2) What is Kubernetes?
    3) What is CI/CD?
    4) Locust: what, why, how?
    5) How to use Locust, Kubenetes, and Cloud Build to perform load testing in automated, distributed, and integrated in CI/CD pipeline fashion.
